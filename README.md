# QuantumTeleportation
Demonstrated quantum teleportation of a |o> state.

From the histogram plot at the end of the code, we see that the qubit 0’s state of |1> has
successfully been teleported to qubit 2. The classical measurement always has a 1 in the 2nd
qubit’s position, meaning qubit 2 collapses to the classical 1 bit 100% of the time.
